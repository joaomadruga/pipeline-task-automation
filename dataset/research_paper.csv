Error Handling,"I tried extracting text from a PDF, but it returned gibberish. What should I do?","If you're encountering gibberish when extracting text from a PDF, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** If the PDF contains scanned images of text, using OCR can help convert those images into readable text. You can utilize a text extraction tool that supports OCR to clean and standardize the text.

2. **Extract and Summarize:** Once the text is extracted, consider summarizing the content to focus on the key points. This can help you understand the main ideas without getting lost in the gibberish.

3. **Compile a Report:** After summarizing, you can compile the summaries into a structured report for easy reference. This will help you navigate through the information more effectively.

### Example of Extracted Content:
- **Advancements in Neural Networks:** Discusses recent advancements in neural networks, highlighting key breakthroughs.
