# Pipeline Task Automation  

## Overview  
This project aims to create an **Automation Developer** focused exclusively on automating manual parts of development pipelines. By leveraging automation techniques and intelligent agents, the system reduces repetitive tasks and improves workflow efficiency.

This repository is part of a **TCC (Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso)** project.

## Features  
- **Pipeline Task Automation**: Automates manual steps such as notifications, report generation, and routine checks.  
- **Focused Automation Developer**: Designed to act as a virtual assistant, managing tedious pipeline tasks.  
- **Adaptability**: Integrates with various development pipeline tools and workflows.  

## How It Works  
This system utilizes a modular approach where each automation component is tailored to specific pipeline tasks. These components can be easily extended or replaced to fit the needs of different projects.  

## Goals  
- Eliminate manual interventions in pipelines for low-impact tasks.  
- Ensure consistency and reduce human error in repetitive processes.  
- Save developer time by automating trivial yet necessary activities.  

## Usage  
### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipeline-task-automation.git
   cd pipeline-task-automation
