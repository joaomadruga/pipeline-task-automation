# Pipeline Task Automation

## Overview  
This project implements a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** to automate minor, repetitive tasks in software development pipelines. By leveraging autonomous agents, the system aims to improve development efficiency and reduce manual interventions for low-impact yet time-consuming tasks.

This repository is part of a **TCC (Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso)** project.

## Features  
- **Task Automation:** Automates minor tasks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., report generation, code linting feedback).  
- **Modular Agent Design:** Each agent is designed to perform a specific task, ensuring scalability and adaptability.  
- **Customizable Workflow:** Easily integrate the system into existing development pipelines.  

## Technologies  
- **Python**: Core language for agent logic and integrations.  
- **Multi-Agent Framework**: [Insert Framework if using any, e.g., SPADE, JADE, or your own implementation].  
- **CI/CD Tools**: Integration with platforms like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.
