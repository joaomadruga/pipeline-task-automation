# Development Choices for Multi-Agent System

## Overview

This document outlines the development choices made for implementing a multi-agent system to automate minor impact tasks in development pipelines.

## Agent Pipeline

The pipeline is designed to follow a specific sequence of agent interactions:
- **Human Task Agent**: Initiates the task.
- **Describe Success Criteria Agent**: Defines the success criteria.
- **Developer Agent**: Develops the code.
- **Plan and Solve Agent**: Plans and solves the task.
- **Rag with Docs Agent**: Integrates documentation.
- **Tester (Unit) Agent**: Conducts unit testing.
- **DB Analyst Agent**: Analyzes database requirements.
- **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews the task.
- **Success Criteria Agent**: Ensures the task meets success criteria.

## Langchain Usage

Langchain is used to implement the agents, leveraging its capabilities to create a flexible and scalable multi-agent system.

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each agent is designed to perform a specific task, allowing for easy modification and extension.
- **Scalability**: The system can be expanded with additional agents as needed.
- **Flexibility**: The pipeline can be adjusted to accommodate different workflows.

## Conclusion

The multi-agent system provides an efficient way to automate tasks in development pipelines, reducing manual effort and increasing productivity.
