Below, you will find three sample multi-agent pipelines (each with a specific task and a set of agents), followed by a proposal for comparison criteria that you might use when evaluating frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph. Feel free to adapt or expand these ideas according to your needs.

# 1. Pipeline A: Customer Support Automation

## Task Overview

The goal is to automate customer support inquiries. This includes triaging incoming customer emails, analyzing sentiment, and either providing immediate answers or escalating to a human operator when necessary.

## Agents
1. **Email Ingestion Agent**
			- **Role:** Fetches new emails from the inbox (or a message queue), extracts relevant text, and formats data for further processing.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Connects to an email API or message queue.
					- Filters spam or irrelevant messages using a lightweight classification algorithm.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Agent**
			- **Role:** Analyzes each email’s tone and sentiment.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Runs a sentiment analysis model (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
					- Detects urgency or anger (which might require immediate escalation).
3. **FAQ/Knowledge Base Agent**
			- **Role:** Attempts to find relevant answers from a knowledge base.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Uses a semantic search or retrieval model to query the knowledge base.
					- Generates a draft response if a match is found.
4. **Escalation Agent**
			- **Role:** Decides whether to pass the response to a human operator.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Uses a rule-based approach or a machine learning model to decide escalation threshold.
					- If escalated, packages conversation context for a human agent.

## Process Flow
1. The Email Ingestion Agent pulls in the message.
2. The Sentiment Analysis Agent checks sentiment and urgency.
3. If not urgent, the message is sent to the FAQ/Knowledge Base Agent to attempt an automated response.
4. The Escalation Agent then checks if the generated response is sufficiently confident or if it needs human intervention.
5. Final response is either sent automatically or assigned to a human operator queue.

# 2. Pipeline B: Research Paper Summarization

## Task Overview

Automatically gather newly published research papers, summarize them, and generate a short report highlighting the main findings.

4. Topic Classifier Agent assigns domain labels (e.g., NLP, Computer Vision).
5. Report Generator Agent compiles a summarized report.

# 3. Pipeline C: Code Debugging Assistant

## Task Overview

Assist developers in detecting and fixing bugs in a codebase.

## Agents
1. **Codebase Scanner Agent**
			- **Role:** Scans repositories for changes (commits, pull requests).
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Uses Git hooks or an API to detect new code changes.
					- Identifies relevant files for analysis (e.g., changed files in a pull request).
2. **Static Analysis Agent**
			- **Role:** Applies static analysis rules, linters, and code quality checks.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Identifies common style or syntax issues.
					- Flags potential security vulnerabilities.
3. **Test Generation Agent**
			- **Role:** Generates or updates unit tests for the changed code.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Uses code analysis to suggest new test cases.
					- Evaluates coverage metrics.
4. **Bug Explanation Agent**
			- **Role:** When a bug is found, explains potential causes in natural language.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Maps static analysis or failing tests to probable root causes.
					- Suggests lines of code that might need fixing.
5. **Fix Proposal Agent**
			- **Role:** Suggests code patches or refactors.
			- **Key Abilities:**
					- Uses a trained model (e.g., language model specialized in code) to propose solutions.
					- Automatically creates a patch or pull request with suggested changes.

## Process Flow
1. Codebase Scanner Agent detects new commits.
2. Static Analysis Agent checks code for errors.
3. If issues are found, the Test Generation Agent proposes additional tests.
4. The Bug Explanation Agent offers context and insights.
5. Finally, the Fix Proposal Agent suggests or applies a fix.

# Comparison Criteria

When evaluating multi-agent frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph, you can use the following criteria (and others as you see fit):
1. **Task Performance**
			- **Description:** How quickly and accurately does the system complete the target task?
			- **Measurements:**
					- Execution time (seconds, minutes, etc.).
					- Accuracy, precision, or other domain-specific metrics (e.g., correct classification rate).
					- Resource usage (CPU, memory).
2. **Agents Interaction and Multi-Agent Metrics**
			- **Description:** How effectively do the agents coordinate and communicate within the framework?
			- **Measurements:**
					- Latency in agent-to-agent communication.
					- Number of message exchanges or overhead.
					- Ease of specifying agent roles and orchestrating tasks (is it easy to add or remove agents?).
3. **Robustness**
			- **Description:** How does the framework handle errors, unexpected inputs, or failure in one of the agents?
			- **Measurements:**
					- Ability to recover or retry failed tasks automatically.
					- Logging and error reporting clarity (e.g., how easy it is to debug?).
					- Fault tolerance or fallback strategies (e.g., if Summarization Agent fails, does the system degrade gracefully?).
4. **Scalability**
			- **Description:** How easily can the framework handle an increasing number of agents or heavier loads?
			- **Measurements:**
					- Performance under higher throughput (more simultaneous tasks).
					- Horizontal/vertical scaling (distributed deployments, containerization, etc.).

8. **Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach**
			- **Description:** Tailor your evaluation using GQM by defining high-level Goals, specific Questions about each goal, and concrete Metrics to measure those answers.
			- **Example:**
					- **Goal:** Ensure system can handle 1000 emails per hour without downtime.
					- **Question:** Does the framework queue or drop messages when load spikes?
					- **Metric:** The number of dropped messages or queue overflow events per hour.
9. **Benchmarking and Reference Tasks**
			- **Description:** Evaluate the framework against standard or publicly available benchmarks.
			- **Measurements:**
					- Execution time or accuracy on standard datasets.

# How to Use These Comparison Criteria
1. **Design or Select a Representative Task:** Decide which of the three pipelines (or another relevant one) you want to implement in each framework.
2. **Apply the Same Pipeline in CrewAI and LangGraph:** Keep as many factors constant as possible: same data, same model endpoints, etc.
3. **Collect Metrics:** Record performance logs (time, accuracy, memory) for each agent. Monitor how easy it is to set up and debug the pipeline.
4. **Analyze Differences:** Using the metrics above, determine which framework better fits your use case. Some might excel in speed, others in user experience or fault tolerance.
5. **Document the Results:** Present the findings in a table or written report, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs for each framework.

By following this structured approach, you’ll have a clear comparison of CrewAI vs. LangGraph (or any other multi-agent frameworks) for your particular tasks and requirements.
